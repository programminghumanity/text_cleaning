# Ideas and random thoughts

All the things I don't want to forget but that don't really fit anywhere yet. 



## UI ideas

A visual text mining tool like scratch? https://scratch.mit.edu/



## Toughts on functionalities

### Reading PDF and other unstructured text

Text mining from PDF will often require using regular expressions to get the data you want or to extract a structure / blocks of text. This is a good example of the problem + solution: http://pablobarbera.com/ECPR-SC104/code/11-data-in-PDFs.html, the conclusion is "If you look at the data frame, you’ll see it’s not completely perfect, but the rest we could edit them by hand, or tweak the function until it works" --> might generally be a problem that each PDF is unique so extracting information is hard and requires tedious work.

Either we count on the user knowing regular expressions of we provide a visual tool to easily use them. This is an example of a tool that helps with regex: http://www.regexbuddy.com.



### Easy API connections

There are a lot of python wrappers to easily connect to APIs, usually they just require the key as input. Academic public new wrappers as new APIs come out which can be added over time.
