This version replaces the Worldwide Caution dated July 2, 2018.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As terrorist attacks, political violence (including demonstrations), criminal activities and other security incidents often take place without any warning, U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to maintain a high level of vigilance and practice good situational awareness when traveling abroad. When planning a trip and prior to departing the United States, U.S. citizens should consult country specific&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html">Travel Advisories&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;and information pages on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en.html">travel.state.gov&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Travelers are also urged to enroll in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;(STEP) to receive security messages and to make it easier to locate you in an emergency. The Department uses these security messages to convey information about terrorist threats, security incidents, planned demonstrations, natural disasters, etc. In an emergency, please contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or consulate or call the following numbers:&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>1 (888) 407-4747&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;(toll-free in the United States and Canada) or&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>1 (202) 501-4444&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;from other countries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>U.S. government facilities worldwide actively monitor potential security threats and may temporarily close or periodically suspend public services to assess their security posture. In those instances, U.S. embassies and consulates will make every effort to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens abroad are urged to monitor the local news and maintain contact with the nearest U.S. Embassy or consulate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terrorist groups including ISIS, al-Qa'ida, their associates, and those inspired by such organizations, are intent on attacking U.S. citizens wherever they are. Extremists may use conventional or non-conventional weapons to target U.S. government and private interests. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods, including edged weapons, pistols and vehicles, as weapons to effectively target crowds. Extremists increasingly aim to identify and attack &amp;quot;soft&amp;quot; targets, such as:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>high-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hotels, clubs and restaurants&lt;/li>
&lt;li>places of worship&lt;/li>
&lt;li>schools&lt;/li>
&lt;li>parks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>shopping malls and markets&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tourism infrastructure and tourist sites&lt;/li>
&lt;li>public transportation systems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>airports&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In multiple regions, terrorists, guerrilla groups and criminals seek to kidnap U.S. citizens to finance their operations or for political purposes. The Department also remains concerned that terrorists could again seek to down aircraft using concealed explosives or hijack commercial flights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Private U.S. citizens should not travel to any country to participate in armed conflict. U.S. citizens are reminded that fighting on behalf of, or providing other forms of support to, designated terrorist organizations can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism, which is a serious crime that can result in penalties, including prison time and large fines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Travel to all areas of Afghanistan is unsafe because of critical levels of kidnappings, hostage taking, suicide bombings, widespread military combat operations, landmines, and terrorist and insurgent attacks, including attacks using vehicle-borne, magnetic, or other improvised explosive devices (IEDs), suicide vests, and grenades. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terrorist and insurgent groups continue planning and executing attacks in Afghanistan. These attacks occur with little or no warning, and have targeted official Afghan and U.S. government convoys and facilities, local government buildings, foreign embassies, military installations, commercial entities, non-governmental organization (NGO) offices, hospitals, residential compounds, tourist locations, transportation hubs, public gatherings, markets and shopping areas, places of worship, restaurants, hotels, universities, airports, schools, gymnasiums, and other locations frequented by U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. Embassy's ability to provide routine and emergency services to U.S. citizens in Afghanistan is severely limited, particularly outside of Kabul. Evacuation options from Afghanistan are extremely limited due to the lack of infrastructure, geographic constraints, and the volatile security situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Family members cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in Afghanistan. Unofficial travel to Afghanistan by U.S. government employees and their family members is restricted and requires prior approval from the Department of State. U.S. Embassy personnel are restricted from traveling to all locations in Kabul except the U.S. Embassy and other U.S. government facilities unless there is a compelling U.S. government interest in permitting such travel that outweighs the risk. Additional security measures are needed for any U.S. government employee travel and movement through Afghanistan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Afghanistan, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/" adhocenable="false">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs, if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. Consider signing a power of attorney.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization, or consider consulting with a professional security organization. Carry a communication device and, where possible, ride in armored vehicles.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Notify a trusted person of your travel itinerary and contact information. Avoid discussing your movement plans in public where you can be overheard or with persons who do not have the need to know.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Exercise increased caution in Guinea due to &lt;b>civil unrest&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Country Summary: &lt;/b>Demonstrations occur frequently throughout the country and are often sporadic and unplanned, making it difficult to predict the size, route, or level of violence or congestion that may occur. Recent demonstrations throughout Middle Guinea, which includes Labe, Mamou, Pita, and Dalaba, have been particularly violent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Any demonstration may turn violent, resulting in injuries and even fatalities. Demonstrators may attack vehicles that attempt to pass through or around the protests, resulting in serious injuries and vehicular damage. Criminals are known to take advantage of the resulting traffic congestion to rob drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Uniformed security forces may also extort drivers and passengers during these incidents.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution&lt;/b> &lt;b>in areas affected by bushfires and air quality issues&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li>Visitors should exercise increased caution when considering travel to areas affected by bushfires until the risks posed by bushfires, and resulting poor air quality, have passed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Authorities may issue evacuation orders to certain areas as conditions warrant. Travelers should follow local evacuation orders.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Smoke from bushfires is causing poor air quality, which can increase health risks for travelers with related health conditions.&amp;nbsp;Check the air quality&amp;nbsp;for your destinations and take precautions as needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Monitor local news media outlets for updates on areas under evacuation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dial 000 (triple zero) for immediate assistance from the police, ambulance service, or fire brigade.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>A novel (new) coronavirus officially known as COVID-19 is causing an outbreak of respiratory illness that began in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization determined the rapidly spreading outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Hong Kong government has reported cases of the novel coronavirus in its special administrative region, has upgraded its response level to emergency, its highest response level, and is taking other steps to manage the novel coronavirus outbreak. On February 8, the Hong Kong government began enforcing a compulsory 14-day quarantine for anyone, regardless of nationality, arriving in Hong Kong who has visited mainland China within a 14-day period. This quarantine does not apply to individuals transiting Hong Kong International Airport and certain exempted groups such as flight crews. However, health screening measures are in place at all of Hong Kong’s borders and the Hong Kong authorities will quarantine individual travelers, including passengers transiting the Hong Kong International Airport, if the Hong Kong authorities determine the traveler to be a health risk. Please refer to the Hong Kong government’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202002/07/P2020020700674.htm" adhocenable="false">press release&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;for further details.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On January 30, the Hong Kong government closed certain transportation links and border checkpoints connecting Hong Kong with mainland China until further notice, and on February 3 suspended ferry services from Macau.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On February 10, 2020 the Department of State allowed for the voluntary departure of non-emergency U.S. Government employees and their family members due to the novel coronavirus and the effect to Mission personnel as schools and some public facilities have been closed until further notice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On February 19, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/coronavirus-global" adhocenable="false">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;(CDC) issued a Level 1 Warning: Practice Usual Precautions in Hong Kong for COVID-19.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Department of State has raised the Travel Advisory for mainland China to Level 4: Do Not Travel due to the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. The CDC has issued a Level 3 Warning for China: Avoid all nonessential travel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this time, CDC does&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;recommend canceling or postponing travel to Hong Kong. If you travel to Hong Kong, take the following steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Avoid contact with sick people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clean your hands often by washing them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at 60%–95% alcohol. Soap and water should be used if hands are visibly dirty.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p style="margin-left: 80px;">o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It is especially important to clean hands after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you spent time in Hong Kong during the past 14 days and feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Seek medical advice. Call ahead before going to a doctor’s office or emergency room. Tell them about your recent travel to Hong Kong, an area with community spread of coronavirus, and your symptoms.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid contact with others.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not travel while sick.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clean your hands by washing them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60%–95% alcohol immediately after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose. Soap and water should be used if hands are visibly dirty.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Please monitor the Hong Kong government’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/index.html" adhocenable="false">website&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;for further updates on the coronavirus infection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/coronavirus-global" adhocenable="false">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/novel-coronavirus-china&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2Fnovel-coronavirus-2019.html" adhocenable="false">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/novel-coronavirus-2019.html&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;for additional guidance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Exercise increased caution in Hong Kong due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>civil unrest, risk of surveillance, and arbitrary enforcement of laws other than for maintaining law and order.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Country Summary:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>In May 2020, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) National People’s Congress announced its intention to unilaterally and arbitrarily impose national security legislation on Hong Kong that could fundamentally alter its autonomy and freedoms. As a result of this action by the PRC, U.S. citizens traveling or residing in Hong Kong may be subject to increased levels of surveillance, as well as arbitrary enforcement of laws and detention for purposes other than maintaining law and order.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since June 2019, large scale and smaller political demonstrations have taken place in various areas of Hong Kong, including MTR stations, shopping malls, universities, and at Hong Kong International airport.&amp;nbsp; Protests, can take place with little or no notice at any time of the week. While many demonstrations have been peaceful, some have resulted in violent confrontations in which police have used a variety of crowd control measures, including tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, and water cannons. Any protests that take place without a permit are considered illegal and police may detain or use force against persons they believe have participated in protests. U.S. citizens are strongly cautioned to be aware of their surroundings and avoid demonstrations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>U.S. citizens have been subject to a PRC propaganda campaign that falsely accuses individuals of fomenting unrest in Hong Kong, in some cases publishing their personal information,&amp;nbsp;resulting in threats of violence on social media.

&lt;p>If you decide to travel to Hong Kong:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Monitor local media, local transportations sites and apps like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.mtr.com.hk/en/customer/services/mtr_mobile.html" adhocenable="false">MTR Mobile&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.nwstbus.com.hk/content/default.aspx?intLangID=1&amp;amp;section=footer&amp;amp;page=ApptermsOfUse" adhocenable="false">CitybusNWFB&lt;/a>, and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.hongkongairport.com/en/flights/departures/passenger.page" adhocenable="false">Hong Kong International Airport website&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;for updates.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid the areas of the demonstrations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Exercise caution if you are in the vicinity of large gatherings or protests.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid taking photographs of protesters or police without permission.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be aware of your surroundings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep a low profile.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Review your flight status with your airline or at the Hong Kong International Airport&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.hongkongairport.com/en/flights/departures/passenger.page" adhocenable="false">website&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>A novel (new) coronavirus disease, recently designated as COVID-19, is causing an outbreak of respiratory illness. The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in China in December 2019. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization determined the rapidly spreading outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many cases of COVID-19 have been associated with travel to or from mainland China or close contact with a travel-related case, but sustained community spread has been reported in Japan. Sustained community spread means that people in Japan have been infected with the virus, but how or where they became infected is not known, and the spread is ongoing. The CDC has issued a &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/japan?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001">Level 2 Travel Health Notice.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because older adults and those with chronic medical conditions may be at higher risk for severe disease, people in these groups should discuss travel with a healthcare provider and consider postponing nonessential travel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Travelers should review and follow the Centers for Disease Control’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html">guidelines for the prevention of coronavirus&lt;/a> if they decide to travel to Japan. If suspected to have Coronavirus in Japan, you may face travel delays, quarantine, and extremely expensive medical costs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>If you travel to Japan, you should:&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Avoid contact with sick people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discuss travel to Japan with your healthcare provider. Older adults and travelers with underlying health issues may be at risk for more severe disease.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clean your hands often by washing them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at 60%–95% alcohol. Soap and water should be used if hands are visibly dirty.&lt;/li>

Avoid all international travel due to the global impact of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/travel-advisory-alert-global-level-4-health-advisory-issue.html">COVID-19&lt;/a>.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A novel (new) coronavirus is causing an outbreak of respiratory illness that began in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. On January 30, 2020 the World Health Organization determined the rapidly spreading outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Macau government has reported cases of the novel coronavirus in its special administrative region. In an effort to contain the novel coronavirus, the Macau government has placed restrictions on entry to its special administration region on individuals who have been to Hubei Province, China within the previous 14 days and may quarantine those they believe could have been exposed to the coronavirus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As of February 4, ferry services between Hong Kong and Macau have been suspended and flights from Macau International Airport have been reduced. Also, bus drivers may refuse passengers who do not wear face masks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a name="_Hlk31380261">&lt;/a>On February 10, 2020 the Department of State allowed for the voluntary departure of non-emergency U.S. government employees and their family members due to the novel coronavirus and the impact to Mission personnel as schools and some public facilities have been closed until further notice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Department of State has raised the Travel Advisory for China to Level 4: Do Not Travel due to the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. The &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/novel-coronavirus-china">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a> (CDC) has issued a Level 3 Warning: Avoid all nonessential travel to China.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>If you must travel to Macau, you should:&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Monitor the Macau government’s &lt;a href="https://www.gov.mo/en/">website&lt;/a> for further updates on the coronavirus infection.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid contact with sick people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discuss travel to Macau with your healthcare provider. Older adults and travelers with underlying health issues may be at risk for more severe disease.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid animals (alive or dead), animal markets, and products that come from animals (such as uncooked meat).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Maintain drainage pipes properly and add water to U-traps regularly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Put the toilet lid down before you flush to prevent the spread of germs.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;b>If you traveled to Macau in the last 14 days and feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, you should:&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Seek medical care right away. Before you go to a doctor’s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid contact with others.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not travel while sick.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wear a mask and seek medical advice promptly if unwell.&lt;/li>

Avoid all international travel due to the global impact of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/travel-advisory-alert-global-level-4-health-advisory-issue.html">COVID-19&lt;/a>.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do Not Travel to Mongolia &lt;b>due to the Global Health Advisory and Mongolia’s suspension of all international travel in response to the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in neighboring countries&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On March 10, 2020, Mongolia suspended travel to and from foreign locations until at least March 28. Virtually all commercial flights, passenger rail, and auto traffic into and out of Mongolia are suspended during this time period. Domestic air and rail travel will also be suspended from March 10 until at least March 16. For the most up-to-date information regarding COVID-19-related issues affecting travelers in Mongolia please see the &lt;a href="https://mn.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">U.S Embassy in Mongolia’s COVID-19 Information page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On February 25, 2020, the Department of State allowed for the voluntary departure of non-emergency U.S. government employees and all family members. On March 12, the Department ordered the departure of all nonessential personnel &lt;b>due to travel, transport, and other restrictions related to Mongolia’s response to the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Travelers already in Mongolia should be prepared for the potential implementation of further measures with little or no advance notice affecting their ability to move within or depart from Mongolia. Travelers should also review and follow the Centers for Disease Control’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html">guidelines for the prevention of coronavirus&lt;/a>. U.S. citizens currently in Mongolia should attempt to depart by commercial means as soon as it becomes feasible to do so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>U.S. citizens remaining in Mongolia should follow the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Mongolian health authorities’ guidance for prevention, signs and symptoms, and treatment. We strongly urge U.S. citizens remaining in Mongolia to stay home as much as possible and limit contact with others, including large gatherings. Consider stocking up on food and other supplies to limit movement outside the home.&amp;nbsp;If the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the U.S. Embassy to provide assistance to U.S. nationals within Mongolia may be limited.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The country’s health system continues to be taxed by normal seasonal illnesses. Hospital capacity in Ulaanbaatar remains limited, and the additional travel restrictions announced on March 10 may impede people seeking medical evacuation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Government of Mongolia has announced many precautionary measures, including:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Eliminating travel into and out of Mongolia.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Placing travelers in mandatory quarantine upon arrival from specific countries or if they exhibit symptoms identifiable with COVID-19.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Requesting that all travelers arriving from abroad self-quarantine for 14 days.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prohibiting all public gatherings, events, and meetings, such as conferences, sporting events, and concerts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prohibiting school age children from public locations such as restaurants and shopping malls.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Closing schools and universities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Restricting the operating hours of restaurants, bars, and other public locations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Closing public offices, libraries, and community centers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Suspending intercity traffic and limiting access to public transportation.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Health officials have quarantined some travelers, including U.S. citizens, and are actively screening passengers for COVID-19 symptoms at land borders, airports, and at inspection points on roads. Mongolian health authorities are also currently conducting contact tracing for suspected cases of COVID-19.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The situation is evolving rapidly, and the above restrictions may be expanded or prolonged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>If you travel to Mongolia, you should:&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Consult the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">CDC website&lt;/a> for the most up-to-date information.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Exercise increased caution in Papua New Guinea due to &lt;b>crime, civil unrest, health concerns, natural disasters, and kidnapping&lt;/b>. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reconsider Travel to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Areas near the Panguna mine in Bougainville due to &lt;b>civil unrest&lt;/b>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Highlands region due to the long-term effects of a &lt;b>natural disaster&lt;/b> that occurred in February 2018 and &lt;b>civil unrest&lt;/b>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Areas in the vicinity of Mt. Ulawun on the island of New Britain due to &lt;b>natural disaster&lt;/b>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Country Summary&lt;/b>: Violent crime, including sexual assault, carjackings, home invasions, kidnappings, and armed robberies, is common. Tensions between communal or clan groups may result in violence at any time without warning. Police presence is limited outside of the capital Port Moresby, and police may be unable to assist due to limited resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Public demonstrations, especially in population centers, are common and may turn violent. Even peaceful demonstrations may present opportunities for criminal elements or other actors to exacerbate local political tensions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On August 21, 2019, the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel">Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;and Prevention (CDC) released a &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/polio-papua-new-guinea">Level 2 Travel Notice for Papua New Guinea&lt;/a> regarding an outbreak of vaccine-derived poliovirus in the Morobe Province. Refer to the CDC for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/polio-papua-new-guinea">additional information&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;and advice on the outbreak.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens outside of Port Moresby due to limited transportation infrastructure. U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization before traveling to areas of concern, including Bougainville.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Areas Near the Panguna Mine - Level 3: Reconsider Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Autonomous Government of Bougainville has designated areas near the Panguna mine as “no go zones&amp;quot; due to the risk of violence and civil unrest. Bougainville police lack the resources to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens outside of Port Moresby due to limited transportation infrastructure. U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization before traveling to areas of concern, including Bougainville.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Recent years have seen regular volcanic activity at Mt. Ulawun, a volcano on the eastern end of the island of New Britain. A major eruption occurred in June 2019, leading to widespread ash fall, the displacement of local communities, and the temporary closure of the international airport in Hoskins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Smaller, but still significant, eruptions occurred in August and October 2019.Visit our website for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html">Travel to High-Risk Areas&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>UN Buffer Zone: Since 1974, the southern part of Cyprus has been under the control of the government of the Republic of Cyprus. The northern part of Cyprus, administered by Turkish Cypriots, proclaimed itself the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” (“TRNC”) in 1983. The United States does not recognize the “TRNC,” nor does any country other than Turkey. A buffer zone patrolled by the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, separates the two sides. For U.S. citizen travelers:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;b>Enter and exit the Republic of Cyprus ONLY &lt;/b>at Larnaca and Paphos airports and at the seaports of Limassol, Larnaca, and Paphos. The Republic of Cyprus &lt;b>does not consider&lt;/b> entry at Ercan Airport in the north to be a “legal” entrance into Cyprus.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You &lt;b>cannot receive a residency permit&lt;/b> from the Republic of Cyprus to reside in the area north of the UN buffer zone.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Exercise increased caution in France due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>terrorism &lt;/b>and&lt;b> civil unrest&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in France. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Demonstrations in Paris and other major cities continue in France and are expected to continue in the coming weeks. Property damage, including looting and arson, in populated tourist areas has occurred with reckless disregard for public safety. Police have responded with water cannons, rubber bullets, and tear gas. The U.S. Embassy is advising official U.S. government travelers to avoid travel to Paris and other major cities in France on the weekends.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Exercise increased caution in Belize due to &lt;b>crime&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Violent crime – such as sexual assault, home invasions, armed robberies, and murder – are common even during daylight hours and in tourist areas. A significant portion of violent crime is gang-related. Due to high crime travelers are advised to exercise caution while traveling to the south side of Belize City. Local police lack the resources and training to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents. Most crimes remain unresolved and unprosecuted.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Do not travel to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Any areas within 150 km/100 miles of Brazil’s land borders with Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Paraguay due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>crime&lt;/b>. (Note: &amp;nbsp;This does not apply to the Foz do Iguacu National Park or Pantanal National Park.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Informal housing developments (commonly referred to in Brazil as favelas, vilas, comunidades, and/or conglomerados) at any time of day due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>crime&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;(see additional information below).&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Country Summary:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b>Violent crime, such as murder, armed robbery, and carjacking, is common in urban areas, day and night. &amp;nbsp;Gang activity and organized crime is widespread. &amp;nbsp;Assaults are common.&amp;nbsp; U.S. government personnel are discouraged from using public, municipal buses in all parts of Brazil due to an elevated risk of robbery and assault at any time of day, and especially at night.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you decide to travel to Brazil:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Be aware of your surroundings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use caution when walking or driving at night.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid walking on beaches after dark.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not display signs of wealth, such as wearing expensive watches or jewelry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be extra vigilant when visiting banks or ATMs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use caution at, or going to, major transportation centers or on public transportation, especially at night. &amp;nbsp;Passengers face an elevated risk of robbery or assault using public, municipal bus transportation throughout Brazil. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use increased caution when hiking in isolated areas.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;b>International Borders – Level 4: Do Not Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>U.S. government personnel are not permitted to travel to areas within 150 km/100 miles of the international land borders with Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Paraguay without advance approval from security officials due to crime. &amp;nbsp;Travel to the Foz do Iguacu National Park and Pantanal National Park is permitted.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Informal Housing Developments (commonly known as “Favelas”) – Level 4: Do Not Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do not travel to informal housing developments (commonly referred to in Brazil as favelas, vilas, comunidades, and/or conglomerados), even on a guided tour. &amp;nbsp;Neither the tour companies nor the police can guarantee your safety when entering these communities. &amp;nbsp;Even in these communities that the police or local governments deem safe, the situation can change quickly and without notice.&amp;nbsp; While some informal housing developments have clear boundaries or gates, or even names such as “favela”, “vila”, “comunidade”, or “conglomerado”, other such developments may be less obvious, and may be identified by crowded quarters, poorer conditions, and/or irregular construction. &amp;nbsp;In addition, exercise caution in areas surrounding these communities, as occasionally, inter-gang fighting and confrontations with police move beyond the confines of these communities. &amp;nbsp;Except under limited circumstances and with advance approval, U.S. government personnel are not permitted to enter any informal housing developments in Brazil.

&lt;p>Without advance approval from security officials, U.S. government personnel are not permitted to travel to Brasilia’s Administrative Regions of Ceilandia, Santa Maria, Sao Sebastiao, and Paranoa between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. (non-daylight hours) due to crime.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Do not travel to South Sudan due to &lt;b>crime, kidnapping, &lt;/b>and &lt;b>armed conflict&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Country Summary: &lt;/b>Violent crime, such as carjackings, shootings, ambushes, assaults, robberies, and kidnappings is common throughout South Sudan, including Juba. Foreign nationals have been the victims of rape, sexual assault, armed robberies, and other violent crimes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Armed conflict is ongoing and includes fighting between various political and ethnic groups. Weapons are readily available to the population. In addition, cattle raids occur throughout the country and often lead to violence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reporting in South Sudan without the proper documentation from the South Sudanese Media Authority is considered illegal, and any journalistic work there is very dangerous. Journalists regularly report being harassed in South Sudan, and many have been killed while covering the conflict.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in South Sudan. U.S. government personnel in South Sudan are under a strict curfew. They must use armored vehicles for nearly all movements, and official travel outside Juba is limited. Due to the critical crime threat in Juba, walking is also restricted; when allowed, it is limited to a small area in the immediate vicinity of the Embassy and during daylight hours only. Family members cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in South Sudan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of South Sudan, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Read the Safety and Security section on the &lt;a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/SouthSudan.html">country information page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you decide to travel to South Sudan:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Exercise extreme care in all parts of the country, including Juba. Travel outside of Juba with a minimum of two vehicles along with appropriate recovery and medical equipment in case of mechanical failure or other emergency.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid travel along border areas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings. Even events intended to be peaceful can become violent.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be aware that photography in public is strictly controlled and you are required to obtain authorization from the Ministry of Information before taking any photographs or video in public – including while inside a vehicle.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Monitor local/international news and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://ss.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/">consular messages&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enroll your trip in the State Department's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program&amp;nbsp;(STEP)&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Review your personal security plan and visit our page on travel to high risk areas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Share important documents, log-in information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs, if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. &lt;a href="https://www.everplans.com/articles/checklist-documents-to-organize-and-share">Find a suggested list of such documents here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization, or consider consulting with a professional security organization. Your plan should include sheltering in place, maintaining outside communication, and a personal evacuation plan via commercial means.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. This plan should specify who you would contact first, and how they should share the information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be sure to appoint one family member to serve as the point of contact with hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and Members of Congress, if you are taken hostage or detained.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones, so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones can know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Erase any sensitive photos, comments, or other materials from your social media pages, cameras, laptops, and other electronic devices that could be considered controversial or provocative by local groups.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leave your expensive/sentimental belongings behind.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Do not travel to Haiti due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>crime&lt;/b>,&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>civil unrest, and kidnapping&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Country Summary:&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;Violent crime, such as armed robbery and carjacking, is common. Kidnapping is widespread. Kidnappers may use sophisticated planning or take advantage of unplanned opportunities. Victims have included U.S. citizens. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Demonstrations, tire burning, and roadblocks are frequent, unpredictable, and can turn violent. Local police may lack the resources to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents. Emergency response, including ambulance service, is limited or non-existent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Travelers are sometimes followed and violently attacked and robbed shortly after leaving the Port-au-Prince international airport. The U.S. Embassy requires its personnel to use official transportation to and from the airport. Robbers and carjackers have attacked private vehicles stuck in heavy traffic congestion and often target lone drivers, particularly women driving alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in some areas of Haiti. U.S. government personnel are discouraged from walking in most neighborhoods. Only adult family members over the age of 18 are permitted to accompany U.S. government employees assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince. U.S. government personnel in Haiti are prohibited from:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Visiting establishments after dark without secure, on-site parking;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using any kind of public transportation or taxis;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Visiting banks and using ATMs;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Driving outside of Port-au-Prince at night;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Traveling anywhere between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Visiting certain parts of the city at any time without prior approval and special security measures in place.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>If you decide to travel to Haiti:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Avoid demonstrations and crowds. Do not attempt to drive through roadblocks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Arrange airport transfers and hotels in advance, or have your host meet you upon arrival.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not provide personal information to unauthorized individuals (i.e. people without official uniforms or credentials) located&amp;nbsp;in the immigration,&amp;nbsp;customs, or other&amp;nbsp;areas inside&amp;nbsp;or near&amp;nbsp;any airports.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are being followed as you leave the airport, drive to the nearest police station immediately.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Travel by vehicle to minimize walking in public.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Travel in groups of at least two people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Always keep vehicle doors locked and windows closed when driving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li>Exercise caution and alertness, especially when driving through markets and other traffic congested areas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Exercise increased caution in India due to &lt;b>crime and terrorism.&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do not travel to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The state of Jammu and Kashmir (except the eastern Ladakh region and its capital, Leh) due to &lt;b>terrorism and civil unrest&lt;/b>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Within 10 km of the India-Pakistan border due to &lt;b>the potential for armed conflict.&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Indian authorities report rape is one of the fastest growing crimes in India. Violent crime, such as sexual assault, has occurred at tourist sites and in other locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and government facilities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in rural areas from eastern Maharashtra and northern Telangana through western West Bengal as U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization to travel to these areas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p&gt;If you decide to travel to India:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Do not travel alone, particularly if you are a woman. Visit our website for &lt;a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/Women.html">Women Travelers&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;b>State of Jammu and Kashmir&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terrorist attacks and violent civil unrest are possible in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Avoid all travel to this state (with the exception of visits to the eastern Ladakh region and its capital, Leh). Sporadic violence occurs particularly along the Line of Control (LOC) separating India and Pakistan, and in tourist destinations in the Kashmir Valley: Srinagar, Gulmarg, and Pahalgam. The Indian government prohibits foreign tourists from visiting certain areas along the LOC.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>India-Pakistan Border&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>India and Pakistan maintain a strong military presence on both sides of the border. The only official India-Pakistan border crossing point for persons who are not citizens of India or Pakistan is in the state of Punjab between Atari, India, and Wagah, Pakistan. The border crossing is usually open, but confirm the current status of the border crossing prior to commencing travel. A Pakistani visa is required to enter Pakistan. Only U.S. citizens residing in India may apply for a Pakistani visa in India. Otherwise apply for a Pakistani visa in your country of residence before traveling to India.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Northeastern States&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Incidents of violence by ethnic insurgent groups, including bombings of buses, trains, rail lines, and markets, occur occasionally in the northeast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling to the states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Manipur without special authorization from the U.S. Consulate General in Kolkata.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Central and East India&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maoist extremist groups, or “Naxalites,” are active in a large swath of India from eastern Maharashtra and northern Telangana through western West Bengal, particularly in rural parts of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand and on the borders of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, and Odisha. The Naxalites have conducted frequent terrorist attacks on local police, paramilitary forces, and government officials.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to the fluid nature of the threat, all U.S. government travelers to states with Naxalite activity must receive special authorization from the U.S. consulate responsible for the area to be visited. U.S. officials traveling only to the capital cities in these states do not need prior authorization.&lt;/p>

Avoid all international travel due to the global impact of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/travel-advisory-alert-global-level-4-health-advisory-issue.html">COVID-19&lt;/a>.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do not travel to Iran due to the risk of&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>kidnapping&lt;/b> and the arbitrary&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>arrest and detention of U.S. citizens&lt;/b>. Those present in Iran should exercise increased caution due to an &lt;b>outbreak of COVID-19&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Country Summary: &lt;/b>U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Iran have been kidnapped, arrested, and detained on spurious charges. Iranian authorities continue to unjustly detain and imprison U.S. citizens, particularly dual national Iranian-Americans--including students, journalists, business travelers, and academics--on charges including espionage and posing a threat to national security. Iranian authorities routinely delay consular access to detained U.S. citizens and consistently deny consular access to dual U.S.-Iranian citizens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A novel (new) coronavirus disease, recently designated as COVID-19 and also known as the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is causing an outbreak of respiratory illness in several countries around the world. The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in China in December 2019. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization determined the rapidly spreading outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Iran is experiencing sustained community spread&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/novel-coronavirus-2019.html">of COVID-19.&lt;/a> The virus can spread from person to person. Older adults and those with chronic medical conditions should consider postponing nonessential travel. U.S. citizens residing in or traveling to Iran should review and follow the Centers for Disease Control’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/iran">guidelines for the prevention of coronavirus&lt;/a>. Individuals suspected of having COVID-19 may face travel delays, quarantine, and high medical costs. Several countries have closed their borders with Iran and/or suspended air traffic to and from Iran. As a result, commercial travel to and from Iran may become severely limited with little or no notice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government does not have diplomatic or consular relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Iran.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to the risks of operating civilian aircraft within or in the vicinity of Iran, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the&amp;nbsp;&lt;u>&lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices&lt;/a>&lt;/u>.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization, or consider consulting with a professional security organization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Have a plan for departing Iran that does not rely on U.S. government assistance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid contact with sick people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clean your hands often by washing them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at 60%–95% alcohol. Soap and water should be used if hands are visibly dirty.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for violence and kidnapping. Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq and regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias threaten U.S. citizens and Western companies throughout Iraq. Attacks by improvised explosive devices (IEDs) occur in many areas of the country, including Baghdad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On March 25, 2020, the Department of State ordered the departure of designated U.S. government employees from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, the Baghdad Diplomatic support Center, and the U.S. Consulate General in Erbil due to security conditions and restricted travel options as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. On December 31, 2019, the Embassy suspended public consular services, until further notice, as a result of damage done by Iranian-backed terrorist attacks on the Embassy compound. U.S. Consulate General Erbil remains open and continues to provide consular services. On October 18, 2018, the Department of State ordered the suspension of operations at the U.S. Consulate General in Basrah. That institution has not reopened. Due to security concerns, U.S. Embassy personnel in Baghdad have been instructed not to use Baghdad International Airport.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>U.S. citizens should not travel through Iraq to Syria to engage in armed conflict, where they would face extreme personal risks (kidnapping, injury, or death) and legal risks (arrest, fines, and expulsion). The Kurdistan Regional Government stated that it will impose prison sentences of up to ten years on individuals who illegally cross the border. Additionally, fighting on behalf of, or supporting designated terrorist organizations, is a crime that can result in penalties, including prison time and large fines in the United States.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Iraq, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Reconsider travel to Israel and the West Bank due to travel restrictions and quarantine procedures instituted by the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority in response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). U.S. citizens who live in&amp;nbsp;or seek travel to&amp;nbsp;the United States are encouraged to depart Israel, the West Bank, or Gaza immediately while commercial flights are still available, unless they are prepared to remain in place for an indefinite period. Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions related to COVID-19 to be put into effect with little or no advance notice. Flights into or out of Israel may be cancelled with little or no notice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Embassy is not able to assist with arranging commercial travel options. If your travel has been disrupted or to make travel arrangements, please contact your airline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On March 14, the Department of State authorized the departure of U.S. personnel and family members from any diplomatic or consular post in the world who have determined they are at higher risk of a poor outcome if exposed to COVID-19 or who have requested departure based on a commensurate justification.  These departures may limit the ability of U.S. embassies and consulates to provide services to U.S. citizens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On March 18, the Government of Israel announced that foreigners, including U.S. citizens, who are not Israeli citizens or permanent residents, would not be allowed to enter Israel. Exceptions may be made only for non-nationals whose lives are based in Israel. Such individuals who wish to travel to Israel should contact the consular department of the closest Israeli embassy or consulate for further information. We recommend travelers not board flights to Israel without a pre-clearance letter from the Israeli government, as there is otherwise no assurance they will be admitted into the country. The Government of Israel is continually updating its travel restrictions and quarantine policies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As of March 6, 2020, the Palestinian Authority has restricted all foreigners from entering areas of the West Bank under Palestinian Authority control until further notice. Movement and travel between Palestinian districts, including Bethlehem, are restricted to emergencies only.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority have announced restrictions and guidelines, including on movements, gatherings, and public transportation, to reduce the spread of COVID-19. For a full list of guidelines in Israel, please visit the Israeli &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.il/English/Pages/HomePage.aspx">Ministry of Health website&lt;/a> .

As of March 17 and until further notice, the Government of Jordan suspended all international flights and closed all land borders to passenger traffic. Similarly,&amp;nbsp;as of March 19 and until further notice, the Government of Egypt suspended all international flights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most checkpoints between Jerusalem and Bethlehem and Bethlehem’s surrounding suburbs in the West Bank have been closed until further notice. Additional checkpoints might be closed on short notice. All U.S. citizens, including those traveling to Ben Gurion airport for onward departure or passing through any open checkpoints between Israel and the West Bank may be subject to increased scrutiny and significant delays.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>The Border with Syria and Iraq&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Travelers should avoid Jordan's border with Syria and Iraq given the continued threat of cross-border violence, including the risk of terrorist attacks. All U.S. government personnel on official travel must receive prior permission to visit any area within 10 km of the Jordan-Syria border, except the tourist site of Umm Qais or the city of Irbid. U.S. government personnel must also have permission for official travel on Highway 10 east of the town of Ruwayshid toward the Iraq border, or for official visits to refugee camps anywhere in Jordan. Personal travel by U.S. government employees to the border areas or refugee camps is not permitted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Protests&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both planned and impromptu protests may occur throughout Jordan. Avoid demonstrations and follow the guidance of local authorities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Exercise increased caution in Kenya due to &lt;b>crime, terrorism and kidnapping&lt;/b>. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do Not Travel to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Kenya-Somalia border and some coastal areas due to &lt;b>terrorism&lt;/b>.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Nairobi neighborhoods of Eastleigh and Kibera at all times due to &lt;b>crime and kidnapping&lt;/b>. Be especially careful when traveling after dark anywhere in Kenya due to crime.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Violent crime, such as armed carjacking, mugging, home invasion, and kidnapping, can occur at any time. Local police are willing but often lack the capability to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents and terrorist attacks. Emergency medical and fire service is also limited.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terrorist attacks have occurred with little or no warning, targeting Kenyan and foreign government facilities, tourist locations, transportation hubs, hotels, resorts, markets/shopping malls, and places of worship. Terrorist acts have included armed assaults, suicide operations, bomb/grenade attacks, and kidnappings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating in the vicinity of the Kenyan-Somali border, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). For more information, U.S. citizens should consult&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some schools and other facilities acting as cultural rehabilitation centers are operating in Kenya with inadequate or nonexistent licensing and oversight. Reports of minors and young adults being held in these facilities against their wills and physically abused are common.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Individuals cannot use a U.S. passport to travel to, in, or through North Korea without a special validation from the Department of State.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Special validations are granted only in very limited circumstances.

&lt;p>The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in North Korea as it does not have diplomatic or consular relations with North Korea. Sweden serves as the protecting power for the United States in North Korea, providing limited emergency services.

&lt;p>Level 4 - Do Not Travel to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;nbsp;Daegu due to the level of community transmission of the virus and imposition of local quarantine procedures.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>A novel coronavirus is causing an outbreak of COVID-19&lt;b>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>in South Korea. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization determined the COVID-19 outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).&amp;nbsp; The South Korean government has reported cases of the COVID-19 in the country and has upgraded its response level to “grave”, its highest response level.&amp;nbsp;On February 24, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a adhocenable="false" href="https://www.cdc.gov/">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&amp;nbsp;(CDC)&lt;/a> issued a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/south-korea" adhocenable="false">Level 3 Travel Warning ­ Avoid Non-essential Travel for South Korea&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp; Travelers should review and follow the Centers for Disease Control’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html" adhocenable="false">guidelines for the prevention of coronavirus&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;if they decide to travel to South Korea. &amp;nbsp;If suspected to have COVID-19 (coronavirus) in South Korea, you may face travel delays, quarantine, and extremely expensive medical costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>If you travel to South Korea, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends individuals take the following steps:&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Avoid contact with sick people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discuss&amp;nbsp;travel to South Korea with your&amp;nbsp;healthcare provider. Older adults and travelers with chronic medical conditions may be at risk for more severe disease.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clean your hands often by washing them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60%–95% alcohol. Soap and water should be used if hands are visibly dirty.&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It is especially important to clean hands after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;b>If you spent time in South Korea during the past 14 days and feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing the Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends individuals:&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Seek medical advice. Call ahead before going to a doctor’s office or emergency room. Tell them about your recent travel to South Korea, and your symptoms.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid contact with others.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not travel while sick.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clean your hands by washing them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60%–95% alcohol immediately after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose. &amp;nbsp;Soap and water should be used if hands are visibly dirty.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Reconsider travel Lebanon due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>crime,&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>terrorism, armed conflict, civil unrest and due to&amp;nbsp;the Global Health Advisory and Embassy Beirut’s limited capacity to provide support to U.S. citizens. &lt;/b>Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On June 15, 2020, the Department of State ended its ordered departure of non-emergency U.S. government employees and eligible family members which had been in effect since March 18. Read the entire Travel Advisory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do Not Travel to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the border with Syria due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>terrorism&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>and&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>armed conflict&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the border with Israel due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>the potential for&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>armed conflict&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>refugee settlements due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>the potential for&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>armed conflict&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>U.S. citizens should reconsider or avoid travel to certain areas in Lebanon because of the threats of terrorism, armed clashes, kidnapping, and outbreaks of violence, especially near Lebanon’s borders with Syria and Israel. U.S. citizens living and working in Lebanon should be aware of the risks of remaining in the country and should carefully consider those risks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>U.S. citizens who choose to travel to Lebanon should be aware that consular officers from the U.S. Embassy are not always able to travel to assist them. The Department of State considers the threat to U.S. government personnel in Beirut sufficiently serious to require them to live and work under strict security restrictions. The internal security policies of the U.S. Embassy may be adjusted at any time and without advance notice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Lebanon. The potential exists for death or injury in Lebanon because of the attacks and bombings perpetrated by terrorist groups. Terrorists may conduct attacks with little or no warning targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Lebanese government cannot guarantee the protection of U.S. citizens against sudden outbreaks of violence. Family, neighborhood, or sectarian disputes can escalate quickly and can lead to gunfire or other violence with no warning. Armed clashes have occurred along the Lebanese borders, in Beirut, and in refugee settlements. The Lebanese Armed Forces have been brought in to quell the violence in these situations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since October 17, 2019, Lebanon has witnessed frequent demonstrations by protesters seeking changes in government. While most protests have been peaceful, a few have involved violence. U.S. citizens should avoid demonstrations and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings or protests. During the current period of civil unrest, protesters have blocked major roads, including the primary road to the U.S. Embassy and the primary road between downtown Beirut and Rafiq Hariri International Airport.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kidnapping, whether for ransom, political motives, or family disputes, has occurred in Lebanon. Suspects in kidnappings may have ties to terrorist or criminal organizations.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Border with Syria – Level 4: Do Not Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since August 2014, deadly terror attacks have occurred in border towns along Lebanon’s border with Syria, as have episodic clashes between the Lebanese Army and Syrian-based violent extremist groups. A 2017 Lebanese Army offensive expelled ISIS militants from territory along Lebanon’s border with Syria. The U.S. Embassy strongly urges U.S. citizens to avoid the Lebanese-Syrian border region. The U.S. Department of State also warns U.S. citizens of the risk of traveling on flights that fly over Syria, which include some flights to Beirut.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Border with Israel – Level 4: Do Not Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There have been sporadic rocket attacks from southern Lebanon into Israel in connection with the violence between Israel and Hizballah: the last reported incident was in 2014. The U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to avoid this border area.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Refugee Settlements – Level 4: Do Not Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Do not travel to Libya due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, &lt;/b>and&lt;b> armed conflict&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Crime levels in Libya remain high, including the threat of kidnapping for ransom. Westerners and U.S. citizens have been targets of these crimes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Libya. Violent extremist activity in Libya remains high, and extremist groups have made threats against U.S. government officials, citizens, and interests. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, hotels, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Outbreaks of violence between competing armed groups can occur with little warning and have the potential to impact U.S. citizens. The capital, Tripoli, and other cities, such as Surman, Al-Jufra, Misrata, Ajdabiya, Benghazi, Sabha, and Dernah, have witnessed fighting among armed groups, as well as terrorist attacks. Hotels and airports frequented by Westerners have been caught in the crossfire. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Militia groups sometimes detain travelers for arbitrary reasons, do not grant detainees access to a lawyer or legal process, and do not allow detainees to inform others of their status. U.S. citizens should carry proof of citizenship and valid immigration status at all times, but having these documents does not guarantee fair treatment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some international and national airports are closed, and flights out of operational airports are sporadic and may be cancelled without warning. The U.S. government is very concerned about the targeting of commercial transportation in Libya and prohibits U.S. commercial aviation operations within Libyan airspace.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency or routine assistance to U.S. citizens in Libya, as the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli suspended its operations in July 2014.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Areas Designated Off-Limits by the Mauritanian Military – Level 4: Do Not Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The government of Mauritania designates certain areas off-limits to foreigners and most Mauritanians. These “No Movement Zones” are extremely dangerous due to their proximity to Mali, where armed groups engaged in an active insurgency carry out cross-border attacks into Mauritania. The government of Mauritania does not maintain a substantial presence in these areas and thus police are unable to respond to most incidents there. In addition, cell phone coverage and paved roads are nonexistent. U.S. officials are unable to travel to these places. Since the boundaries of such areas frequently change, U.S. citizens should pay attention to all posted signs and notices of restricted entry. They should presume the following areas are off-limits:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>All areas north of the Tropic of Cancer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All areas east of 08⁰ longitude (West of Greenwich) situated within 100km of the Mali Border&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Exercise increased caution in Mexico due to &lt;b>crime &lt;/b>and&lt;b> kidnapping&lt;/b>. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Violent crime – such as homicide, kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery – is widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in many areas of Mexico, as travel by U.S. government employees to certain areas is prohibited or significantly restricted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>U.S. government employees may not travel between cities after dark, may not hail taxis on the street, and must rely on dispatched vehicles, including from app-based services like Uber or from regulated taxi stands. U.S. government employees may not drive from the U.S.-Mexico border to or from the interior parts of Mexico, with the exception of daytime travel within Baja California, between Nogales and Hermosillo on Mexican Federal Highway 15D, and between Nuevo Laredo and Monterrey on Highway 85D (during daylight hours and with prior Consulate authorization only).&lt;/p>

&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use toll roads when possible and avoid driving alone or at night. In many states, police presence and emergency services are extremely limited outside the state capital or major cities.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Exercise increased caution when visiting local bars, nightclubs, and casinos.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not display signs of wealth, such as wearing expensive watches or jewelry.&lt;br>

&lt;p>&lt;b>&lt;u>Aguascalientes state – Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution&lt;/u>&lt;/b>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>&lt;u>Baja California state – Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution&lt;/u>&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Exercise increased caution due to crime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Criminal activity and violence occur throughout the state. Particularly notable is the number of homicides in non-tourist areas of Tijuana. Most homicides appeared to be targeted; however, criminal organization assassinations and turf battles can result in bystanders being injured or killed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to poor cellular service and hazardous road conditions, U.S. government employees may only travel on Highway 2D between Mexicali and Tijuana during daylight hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are no additional restrictions on travel for U.S. government employees in Baja California, which includes tourist areas in: &lt;b>Ensenada, Rosarito, &lt;/b>and&lt;b> Tijuana&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>&lt;u>Chihuahua state – Level 3: Reconsider Travel&lt;/u>&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reconsider travel due to crime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Violent crime and gang activity are common. The vast majority of homicides are targeted assassinations against members of criminal organizations. Battles for territory between criminal groups have resulted in violent crime in areas frequented by U.S. citizens and U.S. government employees, including restaurants and malls during daylight hours. Bystanders have been injured or killed in shooting incidents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>U.S. government employees may only travel to the following locations within the state of Chihuahua and with the noted restrictions:&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Mexican authorities in Chihuahua occasionally operate at a heightened level of security, sometimes referred to as “Alerta Roja” (Red Alert).&amp;nbsp; During those periods, U.S. government personnel must receive prior approval and exercise increased caution when visiting Mexican law enforcement offices or installations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Travel by U.S. government employees to all other areas of the state of Chihuahua, including Copper Canyon, is prohibited.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>U.S. government employees may travel to Puerto Peñasco via the Lukeville/Sonoyta crossing during daylight hours on Federal Highway 8, or by using Federal Highway 15 south from Nogales and east via Federal Highway 2 and State Highway 37 through Caborca during daylight hours.

&lt;p>&lt;b>&lt;u>Tamaulipas state – Level 4: Do Not Travel&lt;/u>&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do not travel due to crime and kidnapping.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Organized crime activity – including gun battles, murder, armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, forced disappearances, extortion, and sexual assault – is common along the northern border and in Ciudad Victoria. Criminal groups target public and private passenger buses as well as private automobiles traveling through Tamaulipas, often taking passengers hostage and demanding ransom payments. Heavily armed members of criminal groups often patrol areas of the state in marked and unmarked vehicles and operate with impunity particularly along the border region from Reynosa northwest to Nuevo Laredo. In these areas, local law enforcement has limited capability to respond to crime incidents. There are greater law enforcement capabilities in the tri-city area of Tampico, Ciudad Madero, and Altamira, which has a lower rate of violent criminal activity compared to the rest of the state.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a name="_Hlk22111749">&lt;/a>U.S. government employees may only travel within a limited radius around and between the U.S. Consulates in Nuevo Laredo and Matamoros, their homes, the respective U.S. Ports of Entry, and limited downtown sites. &amp;nbsp;U.S. government employees may not travel between cities in Tamaulipas using interior Mexican highways and they must observe a curfew between midnight and 6:00 a.m. in the cities of Matamoros and Nuevo Laredo.

&lt;p>&lt;b>Some northern districts in Cabo Delgado Province – Level 4: Do Not Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There have been frequent attacks by armed extremists, threats of violence, and other forms of assault in the districts of&amp;nbsp;Ancuabe, Ibo,&amp;nbsp;Macomia,&amp;nbsp;Meluco,&amp;nbsp;Metuge,&amp;nbsp;Mocimboa&amp;nbsp;da Praia,&amp;nbsp;Mueda,&amp;nbsp;Muidumbe,&amp;nbsp;Nangade, Palma, and&amp;nbsp;Quissanga&amp;nbsp;in the northern Cabo Delgado Province that borders Tanzania. These groups have used machetes and firearms to conduct lethal attacks and have burned vehicles and homes. While the attacks have been localized, it is possible that such violence could spill over into other districts.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Brazen&amp;nbsp;terrorist&amp;nbsp;attacks in multiple districts of Cabo Delgado Province present the possibility that the provincial capital of Pemba could also be vulnerable to attack due to the proximity of violent extremist forces, their increasing sophistication, and the symbolic value of the provincial capital as a target.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Reconsider travel to Nicaragua due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>civil unrest, crime,&lt;/b> &lt;b>limited healthcare availability, and arbitrary enforcement of laws&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On September 12, 2018, the U.S. Department of State lifted the ordered departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel and family members. The U.S. Embassy in Managua is open to the public and provides the full range of consular services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Throughout Nicaragua, armed and violent uniformed police or civilians in plain clothes acting as police (“para-police”) continue to target anyone considered to be in opposition to the rule of President Ortega. The government and its affiliated armed groups have been reported to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Arbitrarily detain pro-democracy protestors, with credible claims of torture and disappearances.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Systematically target opposition figures, including clergy, human rights advocates, and members of the press.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prevent certain individuals from departing Nicaragua by air or land.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seize private property.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Arbitrarily search personal phones and computers for anti-government content.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Arbitrarily detain certain individuals with unfounded charges of terrorism, money laundering, and organized crime.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These police and para-police groups often cover their faces, sometimes operate in groups numbering in the hundreds, and use unmarked vehicles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rallies and demonstrations in opposition to the rule of President Ortega have been declared unlawful, but nevertheless occur. Government forces, uniformed police, and para-police have attacked peaceful demonstrators leading to significant numbers of arrests, injuries, and deaths. Looting, vandalism, and arson often occur during unrest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Road blocks, including in Managua and other major cities, may appear and limit availability of food and fuel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Government hospitals are understaffed and may deny treatment to suspected protestors. Some hospitals throughout the country may not be able to assist in emergencies. Ambulances have reportedly refused to respond or have been denied access to areas with individuals needing emergency care.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Violent crime, such as sexual assault and armed robbery, is common.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Civil unrest and poor infrastructure in parts of the country limit the Embassy’s ability to assist U.S. citizens in emergencies. U.S. government personnel must avoid demonstrations and require special permission to travel beyond a three-hour drive from Managua. Additional restrictions on movements by U.S. government personnel may be put in place at any time, depending on local circumstances and security conditions, which can change suddenly.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you decide to travel to Nicaragua:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Consider arrangements to depart the country quickly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ensure your U.S. passport is valid and available for a quick departure from the country, if needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid demonstrations and restrict unnecessary travel.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not attempt to drive through crowds, barricades, or road blocks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Maintain adequate supplies of food, cash, potable water, and fuel in case you need to shelter in place.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use caution when walking or driving at night.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep a low profile.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Country Summary:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>Violent crime, such as armed robbery, is common.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terrorist groups continue plotting kidnappings and possible attacks in Niger. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting foreign and local government facilities and areas frequented by Westerners. Terrorists operate in the areas bordering Mali, Libya, Burkina Faso, and throughout northern Niger. Avoid travel to Niger’s border regions, particularly the Malian border area, Diffa region, and the Lake Chad region. Mali-based extremist groups have crossed the border and conducted multiple lethal attacks on Nigerien security forces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in remote and rural areas as U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization to travel outside of the capital, Niamey, due to security concerns. Outside of Niamey, all U.S. Embassy personnel are required to travel only during daylight hours and in a minimum of a two-vehicle convoy accompanied by armed Nigerien government security escorts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

Avoid all international travel due to the global impact of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/travel-advisory-alert-global-level-4-health-advisory-issue.html">COVID-19&lt;/a>.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reconsider travel to Pakistan due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>terrorism&lt;/b>. Some areas have increased risk; Please read the entire Travel Advisory. Do Not Travel to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Balochistan province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province, including the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>terrorism&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>and&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>kidnapping.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The immediate vicinity of the Line of Control due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>terrorism&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>and&lt;b>&amp;nbsp;the potential for armed conflict.&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Pakistan. A local history of terrorism and ongoing ideological aspirations of violence by extremist elements have led to indiscriminate attacks on civilian as well as local military and police targets. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, military installations, airports, universities, tourist locations, schools, hospitals, places of worship, and&amp;nbsp;government facilities. Terrorists have targeted U.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terrorist attacks continue to happen across Pakistan, with most occurring in Balochistan and KPK, including the former FATA. Large-scale terrorist attacks have resulted in numerous casualties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pakistan’s security environment has improved since 2014 when Pakistani security forces undertook concerted counter terrorist and counter militant operations. There are greater security resources and infrastructure in the major cities, particularly Islamabad, and security forces in these areas may be more readily able to respond to an emergency compared to other areas of the country. While threats still exist, terrorist attacks are rare in Islamabad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Pakistan due to the security environment. Travel by U.S. government personnel within Pakistan is restricted, and additional restrictions on movements by U.S. government personnel outside of U.S. diplomatic facilities may occur at any time, depending on local circumstances and security conditions, which can change suddenly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. Consulate General in Peshawar is unable to provide any consular services to U.S. citizens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or near Pakistan, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/" adhocenable="false">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Balochistan Province – Level 4: Do Not Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do not travel to Balochistan province. Active terrorist groups, an active separatist movement, sectarian conflicts, and deadly terrorist attacks against civilians, government offices, and security forces destabilize the province, including all major cities. In 2019, several bombings occurred in Balochistan province that resulted in injuries and deaths.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>KPK Province, including the former FATA – Level 4: Do Not Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do not travel to KPK province, which includes the former FATA. Active terrorist and insurgent groups routinely conduct attacks against civilians, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), government offices, and security forces. These groups historically have not discriminated between government officials and civilians. Assassination and kidnapping attempts are common, including the targeting of polio eradication teams.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Vicinity of Line of Control – Level 4: Do Not Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do not travel to the India-Pakistan border. Militant groups are known to operate in the area. India and Pakistan maintain a strong military presence on both sides of the border. Indian and Pakistani military forces periodically exchange gunfire and artillery fire across the Line of Control (LoC). The only official Pakistan-India border crossing point for persons who are not citizens of India or Pakistan is in the province of Punjab between Wagah, Pakistan, and Atari, India. Travelers are advised to confirm the status of the border crossing prior to commencing travel. An Indian visa is required to enter India, and no visa services are available at the border.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Exercise increased caution in Russia due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>terrorism&lt;/b>,&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>harassment,&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>and the arbitrary enforcement of local laws&lt;/b>. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do Not Travel to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The North Caucasus, including Chechnya and Mount Elbrus, due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>terrorism, kidnapping,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>and&lt;b>&amp;nbsp;risk of civil unrest&lt;/b>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Crimea due to Russia’s occupation of the Ukrainian territory&lt;b>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>and&lt;b>&amp;nbsp;abuses by its occupying authorities&lt;/b>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Terrorist groups, transnational and local terrorist organizations, and individuals inspired by extremist ideology continue plotting possible attacks in Russia. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>U.S. citizens, including former and current U.S. government and military personnel, who are visiting or residing in Russia have been arbitrarily interrogated or detained by Russian officials and may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion. For this reason, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow has advised all U.S. government and Department of Defense personnel to consider carefully travel to Russia.&amp;nbsp; Russian officials may unreasonably delay U.S. consular assistance to detained U.S. citizens. Russian authorities arbitrarily enforce the law against U.S. citizen religious workers and open questionable criminal investigations against U.S. citizens engaged in religious activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Russia enforces special restrictions on dual U.S.-Russian nationals and may refuse to acknowledge dual U.S.-Russia nationals’ U.S. citizenship, including denying U.S. consular assistance to detained dual nationals, and preventing their departure from Russia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to the Russian government-imposed reduction on U.S. diplomatic personnel in Russia, the U.S. government may have delayed ability to provide services to U.S. citizens, especially in the Saint Petersburg area.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;b>North Caucasus (including Chechnya and Mount Elbrus) – Level 4: Do Not Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terrorist attacks and risk of civil unrest continue throughout the North Caucasus region including in Chechnya, North Ossetia, Ingushetia, Dagestan, Stavropol, Karachayevo-Cherkessiya, and Kabardino-Balkariya. Local gangs have kidnapped U.S. citizens and other foreigners for ransom. There have been credible reports of arrest, torture, and extrajudicial killing of LGBTI persons in Chechnya allegedly conducted by Chechen regional authorities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do not attempt to climb Mount Elbrus, as travelers must pass close to volatile and insecure areas of the North Caucasus region.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens traveling in the North Caucasus region, including Mount Elbrus, as U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling to the region.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The international community, including the United States and Ukraine, does not recognize Russia’s purported annexation of Crimea. There is extensive Russian Federation military presence in Crimea. The Russian Federation is likely to take further military actions in Crimea as part of its occupation of this part of Ukraine. There are continuing abuses against foreigners and the local population by the&amp;nbsp;occupation authorities in Crimea, particularly against those who are seen as challenging their authority on the peninsula.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Exercise increased caution in Saudi Arabia due to &lt;b>terrorism&lt;/b> and &lt;b>the threat of missile and drone attacks on civilian targets&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do not travel to:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within 50 miles of the border with Yemen due to &lt;b>terrorism&lt;/b> and &lt;b>armed conflict.&lt;/b>&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p>Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Saudi Arabia. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. Terrorists have targeted both Saudi and Western government interests, mosques and other religious sites (both Sunni and Shia), and places frequented by U.S. citizens and other Westerners.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regional actors hostile to Saudi Arabia have conducted destructive and sometimes lethal attacks against a variety of targets including critical infrastructure, military facilities, airports, and energy facilities throughout the country, as well as vessels in Red Sea shipping lanes. Riyadh, Yanbu, areas in proximity to Jeddah, the civilian airport in Abha, military installations in the south, and specific oil and gas facilities are examples of recent targets. The Islamic Republic of Iran has supplied Yemen-based Houthis and other regional proxy groups with weapons, including drones, missiles, and rockets. Houthi militants continue to plan and conduct attacks against locations in Saudi Arabia. Violence associated with Iran-supported groups represents a significant threat. U.S. citizens living and working near military bases and critical civilian infrastructure, particularly in the Eastern Province and areas near the border with Yemen, are at heightened risk of missile and drone attack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the following locations, as U.S. Mission personnel and their families are restricted from travel to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Within 50 miles of the Saudi-Yemen border, including the cities of Jizan and Najran, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Qatif in the Eastern province and its suburbs, including Awamiyah.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>U.S. Mission personnel and their families are not permitted to use the airport in Abha without Chief of Mission approval.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman region, including Saudi Arabia, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued an advisory Notice to Airmen (NOTAM).

&lt;p>&lt;b>Yemen Border&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Violence in Yemen has spilled over into Saudi Arabia on a number of occasions. Rebel forces in Yemen fire artillery at Saudi border towns and launch cross-border attacks against Saudi military personnel. Civilians who are near the border with Yemen are at risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens within 50 miles of the Saudi-Yemen border as U.S. government personnel and their families are restricted from travel to this area.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Do not travel to Somalia due to &lt;b>crime&lt;/b>, &lt;b>terrorism&lt;/b>,&lt;b> civil unrest, health issues, kidnapping, &lt;/b>and &lt;b>piracy&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Country Summary: &lt;/b>Violent crime, such as kidnapping and murder, is common throughout Somalia, including Puntland and Somaliland. &amp;nbsp;Illegal roadblocks are also widespread. &amp;nbsp;A number of schools acting as “cultural rehabilitation” facilities are operating throughout Somalia with unknown licensing and oversight. &amp;nbsp;Reports of physical abuse and people being held against their will in these facilities are common.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terrorists continue to plot kidnappings, bombings, and other attacks in Somalia. &amp;nbsp;They may conduct attacks with little or no warning, targeting airports and seaports, government buildings, hotels, restaurants, shopping areas, and other areas where large crowds gather and Westerners frequent, as well as government, military, and Western convoys.&amp;nbsp; Methods of attack can include car bombs, suicide bombers, individual attackers, and mortar fire, among others. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Civil unrest occurs throughout Somalia and can sometimes be violent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Medical facilities across Somalia have limited capacity and are often nonexistent in rural areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pirates are active in the waters off the Horn of Africa, especially in the international waters near Somalia. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has extremely limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Somalia due to the lack of permanent consular presence in Somalia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Somalia, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR).&amp;nbsp; For more information U.S. citizens should consult&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices&lt;/a>.&lt;i>&lt;/i>&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Avoid sailing near the coast of Somalia and review the &lt;u>&lt;a href="http://www.icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre/live-piracy-report">Live Piracy Report&lt;/a>&lt;/u> published by the International Maritime Bureau.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs, if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.&amp;nbsp;&lt;u>&lt;a href="https://www.everplans.com/articles/checklist-documents-to-organize-and-share">Find a suggested list of such documents here&lt;/a>&lt;/u>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization, or consider consulting with a professional security organization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. This plan should specify who you would contact first, and how they should share the information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Identify key sources of possible assistance for you and your family in case of emergency, such as the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate, FBI, the State Department, your employer (if traveling on business), and local friends/family in the high-risk area.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be sure to appoint one family member to serve as the point of contact with hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and Members of Congress, if you are taken hostage or detained.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones, so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones can know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Erase any sensitive photos, comments, or other materials from your social media pages, cameras, laptops, and other electronic devices that could be considered controversial or provocative by local groups.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leave your expensive/sentimental belongings behind.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Exercise increased caution in South Africa due to &lt;b>crime, civil unrest,&lt;/b> &lt;b>and drought&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Violent crime, such as armed robbery, rape, carjacking, mugging, and &amp;quot;smash-and-grab&amp;quot; attacks on vehicles, is common. There is a higher risk of violent crime in the central business districts of major cities after dark.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Demonstrations, protests, and strikes occur frequently. These can develop quickly without prior notification, often interrupting traffic, transportation, and other services; such events have the potential to turn violent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>South Africa’s Western, Eastern, and Northern Cape Provinces are experiencing a severe drought. Water supplies in some areas may be affected. Residential water-use restrictions are in place in Cape Town and other municipalities. Please see links below for current information.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Reconsider travel to Sudan due to &lt;b>crime,&lt;/b> &lt;b>terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Country Summary&lt;/b>: Crime, such as kidnapping, armed robbery, home invasion, and carjacking can occur. This type of crime is more frequent outside of Khartoum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Members of known terrorist groups continue to be in Sudan and could pose a threat. Terrorist groups in Sudan may harm Westerners and Western interests through suicide operations, bombings, shootings, and kidnappings. They may attack with little or no warning, targeting foreign and local government facilities, and areas frequented by Westerners.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Demonstrations can occur with no warning. Recent demonstrations in Khartoum have been planned and peaceful with no police response.&amp;nbsp; However, police and other security forces may respond to public demonstrations with violence. Foreigners could be targeted in reaction to national and international events. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Violence continues along the border between Chad and Sudan and areas that border South Sudan (including the disputed Abyei area). Armed opposition groups are active in Central Darfur state and parts of Blue Nile and South Kordofan states.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Sudan, as U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization from the Sudanese government to travel outside of Khartoum. The U.S. Embassy requires U.S. government personnel in Sudan to use armored vehicles for official travel. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

Avoid all international travel due to the global impact of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/travel-advisory-alert-global-level-4-health-advisory-issue.html">COVID-19&lt;/a>.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do not travel to Syria due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>and&lt;b>&amp;nbsp;armed conflict&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No part of Syria is safe from violence. Kidnappings by armed groups, arbitrary arrests, the use of chemical warfare, shelling, and aerial bombardment pose significant risk of death or serious injury. The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities has also increased hardships inside the country.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. Embassy in Damascus suspended its operations in February 2012. The Czech Republic serves as the protecting power for the United States in Syria. The range of consular services that the Czech Republic provides to U.S. citizens is extremely limited (to include accepting applications for U.S. passports and U.S. Consular Reports of Birth Abroad, as well as providing notarial services), and the U.S. government is unable to provide any emergency services to U.S. citizens in Syria. U.S. citizens in Syria who seek consular services should try to quickly and safely leave the country and contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in a neighboring country, if possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Long standing conflict with neighboring states and porous borders have contributed to a complex and unpredictable security environment. Syria has experienced active armed conflict since 2011.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government particularly warns private U.S. citizens against traveling to Syria to engage in armed conflict. U.S. citizens who undertake such activity face extreme personal risks, including kidnapping by armed groups, arbitrary arrests, injury, or death. The U.S. government does not support this activity. Our ability to provide consular assistance to individuals who are injured or kidnapped, or to the families of individuals who die in the conflict, is extremely limited.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fighting on behalf of or providing other forms of support to designated terrorist organizations, including ISIS and al-Qaeda affiliates, can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism, which is a crime under U.S. law that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is an ongoing risk of kidnapping and detentions of U.S. citizens and Westerners throughout the country. U.S. citizens remain a target, with many abductions having occurred since mid-2012 and as recently as early 2019. U.S. citizens are also targets of arbitrary abduction and detention by the Syrian government and while in detention do not have access to due process or medical attention. Government detention centers are known to be unsanitary facilities where cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment of detainees has been documented, as well as torture and extrajudicial killings. Note: Only the Syrian government can issue a valid entry visa to Syria. Failure to obtain a legitimate entry visa directly from the Syrian government could result in detention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Syria, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/12/10/2018-26680/extension-of-the-prohibition-against-certain-flights-in-the-damascus-flight-information-region-fir">Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR)&lt;/a>, which says that heightened military activity associated with the Syrian conflict may result in the risk of GPS interference, communications jamming, and errant long-range surface to air missiles straying into adjacent airspace within 200 nautical miles of the Damascus Flight Information Region. These activities may inadvertently pose hazards to U.S. civil aviation transiting the region. It also has the potential to spill over into the adjacent airspace managed by neighboring states and eastern portions of the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Syria, the FAA has not assessed the Government of Syria’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the&amp;nbsp;FAA’s safety assessment page. For more information U.S. citizens should consult&amp;nbsp;the FAA’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization, or consider consulting with a professional security organization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. This plan should specify who you would contact first, and how they should share the information.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>On March 13, 2020, the State Department allowed for the voluntary departure of non-emergency personnel and family members of U.S. government employees due to &lt;i>declining commercial flight availability and travel screening procedures implemented by the Government of Tajikistan.&lt;/i>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice. Visit the &lt;a href="https://tj.usembassy.gov/">U.S. Embassy Dushanbe website&lt;/a> for additional information on these new measures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Medical protocols in Tajikistan are not consistent with U.S. standards.&amp;nbsp; Consider declining any medical testing unrelated to COVID-19. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to the possibility of quarantine of unknown length, carry additional supplies of necessary medication in carry-on luggage.&amp;nbsp; Contact the U.S. Embassy if you are subject to quarantine or prior to undergoing any invasive medical testing or procedures.&lt;/p>

U.S. citizens are at risk of death or injury due to the possibility of indiscriminate attacks in public places. Martial law is in force in this region.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in these provinces as U.S government employees must obtain special authorization to travel to these provinces.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Extremist groups have carried out attacks, including kidnapping, in adjacent areas of Burkina Faso and Benin. Attacks may occur with little or no warning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in areas north and northeast of the city of Dapaong as U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization to travel to these areas.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There is a history of violent demonstrations in Sokodé, Bafilo, and Mango, during which protesters and security force members have been injured, and some killed. Police have used tear gas to disperse demonstrations that caused traffic disruptions in city centers and along National Route 1, and arrested demonstrators. Security forces have at times used excessive force to disperse crowds. Authorities have interrupted internet and cellular data services during past protests, making communication difficult and unpredictable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Tunisia. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, museums, resorts, hotels, festivals, nightclubs, restaurants, religious sites, markets/shopping malls, government facilities and security forces. A country-wide state of emergency, which grants security forces more authority to maintain civil order and enables the government to focus on combating terrorism, is in effect.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in some areas of Tunisia. U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization to travel outside greater Tunis. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Turkey. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas. Terrorists have also previously targeted Western tourists and expatriates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Security forces have detained tens of thousands of individuals, including U.S. citizens, for alleged affiliations with terrorist organizations based on scant or secret evidence and grounds that appear to be politically motivated. U.S. citizens have also been subject to travel bans that prevent them from departing Turkey. Participation in demonstrations not explicitly approved by the Government of Turkey, as well as criticism of the government, including on social media, can result in arrest.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Reconsider Travel to Turkmenistan due to the Global Health Advisory and Embassy Ashgabat’s limited capacity to provide support to U.S. citizens.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On March 27, 2020, the Department of State ordered the departure of all family members of U.S. government employees under the age of 18 in addition to the authorized departure of non-emergency personnel and family members of U.S. government employees due to stringent travel restrictions and quarantine procedures that affect commercial flights.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Government of Turkmenistan has implemented enhanced screening and quarantine measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. At this time, there are no scheduled international flights out of Turkmenistan, including medical evacuation flights. Any&amp;nbsp;privately arranged&amp;nbsp;international charter flight, including medevac flights, must use&amp;nbsp;Turkmenabat&amp;nbsp;Airport which is 290 miles by air and 385 miles by road from Ashgabat.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turkmenistan has barred admission to all travelers except&amp;nbsp;Turkmenistani&amp;nbsp;citizens returning home, foreign citizens departing to their home countries, and diplomats on a case-by-case basis if flights are available. All travelers should be aware that they will be required to undergo medical screening and possibly involuntary quarantine at local medical facilities.&amp;nbsp;Passengers will be required to undergo medical screening and possibly involuntary quarantine at local medical facilities.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice. Visit the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftm.usembassy.gov%2F&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C80624d08272b45311a4c08d7d5a4a7d7%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C637212775468635462&amp;amp;sdata=IJEn%2BCjeuhr9gJfDD9EQnioH6qC%2B%2B%2FMOzTuJBphFC5o%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0">website&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;of U.S. Embassy Ashgabat for additional information on these new measures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Medical protocols in Turkmenistan are not consistent with U.S. standards and some travelers have been required to undergo medical testing unrelated to COVID-19. Consider declining any medical testing unrelated to COVID-19.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to the possibility of quarantine of unknown length, carry additional supplies of necessary medication in carry-on luggage. Contact the U.S. Embassy if you are subject to quarantine or prior to undergoing any invasive medical testing or procedures.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Crimea – Level 4: Do Not Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is extensive Russian Federation military presence in Crimea as part of Russia’s occupation and attempted annexation of this part of Ukraine. Occupation authorities continue to abuse and arbitrarily imprison foreigners and the local population, particularly individuals who are seen as challenging Russian authority on the peninsula.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government prohibits its employees from traveling to Crimea and is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Crimea.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Donetsk and Luhansk – Level 4: Do Not Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Russia-led forces continue to control areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, where the ongoing-armed conflict has resulted in more than 10,000 deaths. Individuals, including U.S. citizens, have been threatened, detained, or kidnapped for hours or days after being stopped at checkpoints controlled by Russia-led forces. The U.S. government restricts U.S. government employees from traveling to the eastern parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and adjacent regions, which limits the ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizen in these regions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/travel-advisory-alert-global-level-4-health-advisory-issue.html">&lt;/a>Do not travel to Venezuela due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>crime, civil unrest, poor health infrastructure, kidnapping,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>and&lt;b>&amp;nbsp;arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. citizens&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Country Summary:&lt;/b> On March 11, 2019, the U.S. Department of State announced the withdrawal of diplomatic personnel from U.S. Embassy Caracas. All consular services, routine and emergency, are suspended until further notice. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Venezuela.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Violent crime, such as homicide, armed robbery, kidnapping, and carjacking, is common. Political rallies and demonstrations occur, often with little notice. Demonstrations typically elicit a strong police and security force response that includes the use of tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and rubber bullets against participants and occasionally devolve into looting and vandalism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are shortages of food, electricity, water, medicine, and medical supplies throughout much of Venezuela. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/health-infrastructure-breakdown-venezuela">Level 3 ‘Avoid Nonessential Travel’&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;notice on May 15, 2018 due to inadequate healthcare and the breakdown of the medical infrastructure in Venezuela.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consular access to detained U.S. citizens who also have Venezuelan nationality is severely restricted by the Venezuelan government and the U.S. Embassy may not receive access in these cases. Security forces have arbitrarily detained U.S. citizens for long periods. Venezuelan authorities may not notify the U.S. Embassy of the detention of a U.S. citizen, and consular access to detainees may be denied or severely delayed.&lt;/p>

Avoid all international travel due to the global impact of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/travel-advisory-alert-global-level-4-health-advisory-issue.html">COVID-19&lt;/a>.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/travel-advisory-alert-global-level-4-health-advisory-issue.html">&lt;/a>Do not travel to Yemen due to&amp;nbsp;terrorism, civil unrest, health risks, kidnapping,&amp;nbsp;armed conflict, and landmines. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. Embassy in Sana’a suspended its operations in February 2015, and the U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Yemen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terrorist groups continue to plot and conduct attacks in Yemen. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting public sites, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. Additionally, there is a continuing threat of kidnapping/detention by terrorists, criminal elements, and/or non-government actors. Employees of western organizations may be targeted for attack or kidnapping.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Military conflict has caused significant destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities. This limits the availability of electricity, clean water, and medical care. This instability often hampers the ability of humanitarian organizations to deliver critically needed food, medicine, and water. Critical levels of violence, to include armed conflict, artillery shelling, and air strikes, persist throughout the country. There are also reports of landmines throughout Yemen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cholera is present throughout Yemen. There is a limited availability of medicine and medical supplies, and adequate medical treatment is unavailable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a very high risk of kidnapping, and detention of U.S. citizens in Yemen, particularly dual national Yemeni-Americans. Rebel groups in Sana’a have detained U.S. citizens, including dual Yemeni-American citizens. U.S. citizens, including dual nationals, have faced difficulty – including lengthy delays – when attempting to depart Yemen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Yemen, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices&lt;/a>.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization, or consider consulting with a professional security organization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. This plan should specify who you would contact first, and how they should share the information.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Casualties continue to occur in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.

&lt;p>The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Nagorno-Karabakh as U.S. government employees are restricted from traveling there.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Reconsider travel to Azerbaijan due to the risk of a significant increase of COVID-19 cases emanating from the Iranian border and the Government of Azerbaijan’s response to COVID-19. The Government of Azerbaijan is screening international travelers for symptoms of COVID-19 and has implemented mandatory quarantine for suspected cases in designated quarantine facilities. Travel restrictions imposed in other countries and reduced commercial flight availability may impede people seeking medical evacuation. Medical care in Azerbaijan is not consistent with U.S. standards and basic medical supplies may be unavailable in some areas. Travelers should consider these factors and their health before traveling to Azerbaijan and follow the Centers for Disease Control’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html">guidelines for the prevention of coronavirus&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a>if they decide to travel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On March 6, 2020 the Department of State allowed for the voluntary departure of non-emergency U.S. government employees and their family members.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azerbaijan has a longstanding risk presented by terrorist groups, who continue plotting possible attacks in Azerbaijan. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Level 4 - Do not travel to:&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;b>Nagorno-Karabakh&lt;/b> region due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>armed conflict&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Casualties continue to occur in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Intermittent&amp;nbsp;gunfire and occasional use of&amp;nbsp;artillery systems,&amp;nbsp;including&amp;nbsp;land mines and mortars, result in deaths&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;injuries&amp;nbsp;each year. Avoid roads near the ‘line of contact’ and roads near the international border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Nagorno-Karabakh as U.S. government employees are restricted from traveling there.

&lt;p>Exercise increased caution in the Bahamas due to &lt;b>crime&lt;/b>. Some areas have increased risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Country Summary:&lt;/b> Violent crime, such as burglaries, armed robberies, and sexual assault, occurs even during the day and in tourist areas. Although the family islands are not crime-free, the vast majority of crime occurs on New Providence and Grand Bahama islands. U.S. government personnel are not permitted to visit the area known by many visitors as the Sand Trap area in Nassau due to crime. Activities involving commercial recreational watercraft, including water tours, are not consistently regulated. Watercrafts are often not maintained, and many companies do not have safety certifications to operate in The Bahamas. Jet-ski operators have been known to commit sexual assaults against tourists. As a result, U.S. government personnel are not permitted to use jet-ski rentals on New Providence and Paradise Islands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Exercise caution in the area known as &amp;quot;Over the Hill&amp;quot; (south of Shirley Street) and the Fish Fry at Arawak Cay in Nassau, especially at night.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Minefields and land mines are present throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. While suspected hazardous areas are normally clearly marked, several people are killed or injured each year.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Do not travel to Burkina Faso due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>terrorism,&amp;nbsp;crime, &lt;/b>and&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>kidnapping&lt;/b>.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Country Summary: &lt;/b>Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Burkina Faso. Terrorists may conduct attacks anywhere with little or no warning. Targets could include hotels, restaurants, police stations, customs offices, areas at or near mining sites, places of worship, military posts, and schools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kidnapping and hostage taking is a threat throughout the country.&amp;nbsp; On May 10, 2019 a hostage rescue operation freed four international hostages that had been kidnapped in Burkina Faso and in neighboring Benin.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Government of Burkina Faso has maintained a state of emergency in the entire East and Sahel regions, the provinces of Kossi and Sourou in the Boucle de Mouhoun region, the province of Kenedougou in the Hauts Bassins region, the province of Loroum in the North region, and the province of Koulpelogo in the Center-East region.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens throughout most of the country, as U.S. government personnel are restricted from travelling to regions outside the capitol due to security concerns. The U.S. Embassy prohibits U.S. government personnel from personal travel to the Karpala, Balkiui and Rayongo (also known as Dayongo) neighborhoods of Ouagadougou’s Arrondissement 11 due to the potential for security operations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Family members under the age of 21 cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in Burkina Faso.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Reconsider travel to Burundi due to &lt;b>elections&lt;/b>, &lt;b>crime, health, &lt;/b>and &lt;b>political violence&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Country Summary&lt;/b>: General elections in Burundi are scheduled for May 20, 2020, which may be subject to change.&amp;nbsp; There is a heightened risk of violence during election periods, and during past elections there has been election-related violence. The Burundi government may impose travel restrictions as the elections approach, sometimes without notice, which may affect travel plans. Expect additional police and military checkpoints and possible roadblocks throughout the country during elections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Violent crimes, such as grenade attacks and armed robbery, occur frequently. Though Westerners are unlikely to be targeted, the risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time is high. Local police lack the resources and training to respond effectively to crimes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Medical services in Burundi fall well below U.S. standards, and there are no adequate trauma services in the country. Emergency medical and fire services are limited or non-existent in some areas of the country. The CDC has also issued a &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/malaria-burundi">Level 1 Travel Notice on Malaria in Burundi&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are ongoing political tensions in Burundi, causing sporadic violence throughout the country. Police and military checkpoints are common and can restrict freedom of movement. Police have conducted weapon searches in the homes of private citizens. In the provinces of Cibitoke and Bubanza, near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, as well as Mutimbuzi commune in Bujumbura Rural province, there have been armed attacks primarily conducted by groups operating from the eastern DRC. The border may close without notice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens throughout Burundi. U.S. Embassy personnel are subject to restrictions when traveling in certain areas of Burundi and may be subject to other constraints as security conditions warrant. These restrictions include limitations on travel outside of Bujumbura during hours of darkness (typically 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.) and prior approval for travel to the Bujumbura neighborhoods of Cibitoke, Gasenyi, Kamenge, Kinama, Musaga, Mutakura, and Ngagara.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to travel restrictions on U.S. Embassy personnel, the U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the following areas: the provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke, Kibira National Park (including the park’s southernmost part in Muramvya province), and Ruvubu and Buriri Forest. Embassy personnel are also prohibited from transiting through Kibira National Park to reach Kayanza via the RN-10.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Bring a sufficient supply of over-the-counter and prescription medicines.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Obtain comprehensive medical insurance that includes medical evacuation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid areas where there are large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations, and exercise caution in the vicinity of any such gatherings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remain aware of your surroundings and be vigilant when traveling in unfamiliar areas or outside of cities and along border areas; take appropriate steps to enhance your personal security.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Consider traveling in pairs and using convoys of multiple vehicles to mitigate the risks related to traveling outside of Bujumbura. Carry additional fuel, spare tires, and provisions. Include a satellite phone, map, navigation equipment, and first aid kit. Service stations are scarce in rural areas. Professional roadside assistance service is not available outside the capital.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Phnom Penh&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Street crime, particularly phone and bag snatchings, occurs frequently in areas where foreigners gather; resistance can result in injury. We urge all travelers to be aware of their surroundings at all time and to be extra vigilant when displaying items like jewelry, bags and cell phones in public. Violent crime, such as sexual assault and homicide, is common, sometimes against foreigners.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt. Use caution when walking or driving at night.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Pursat, Siem Reap, Pailin, and Kampong Thom provinces&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Land mines and unexploded ordnance are found in very remote areas throughout Cambodia, and especially in Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Pursat, Siem Reap, Pailin, and Kampong Thom provinces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do not touch unknown metal objects; instead notify the Cambodia Mine Action Center at 012-800-473/023-995-437. Use a local guide when walking in forested areas or dry rice paddies in these areas.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>North, Far North, Northwest and Southwest Regions, and parts of East and Adamawa Regions – Level 4:&amp;nbsp; Do Not Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the Adamawa Region north of the capital, Ngaoundere, and East Regions, there is a heightened criminal threat within 20 kilometers of the border with the Central African Republic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Violent crime, including kidnapping by terrorists and/or kidnapping for ransom, armed robbery, assault, and carjacking are serious concerns in Cameroon, especially in all these regions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In Northwest and Southwest Regions, a separatist movement has led to increased levels of violence. Armed clashes between separatists and government forces, and other acts of violence, including kidnapping for ransom and arson, have occurred. Ongoing conflict has led to a breakdown in order, crimes of opportunity, and a significant decline in medical resources in large areas of both regions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On March 18, 2020, the Department of State allowed for the ordered departure of non-emergency U.S. Government employees and all eligible family members due to stringent travel restrictions and quarantine procedures that affect commercial flights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Violent crime, such as armed robbery, aggravated battery, and homicide, is common.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Large areas of the country are controlled by armed groups who regularly kidnap, injure, and/or kill civilians. In the event of unrest, airport, land border, and road closures may occur with little or no notice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the Central African Republic; U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization to travel outside the Embassy compound.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting foreigners, local security forces, and civilians.&amp;nbsp; They can easily cross borders, including in the Lake Chad region; borders may close without notice.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Exercise increased caution in Chile due to &lt;b>civil unrest&lt;/b>. Read the entire Travel Advisory and Travel Alerts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There have been large-scale demonstrations in Santiago and other major cities in Chile. &amp;nbsp;Demonstrations can take place with little or no notice. &amp;nbsp;Many protests occur with little regard for public safety, and have resulted in property damage, looting, arson, and transportation disruptions.&amp;nbsp; Local authorities have used water cannons and tear gas to disrupt protests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The government-imposed State of Emergency was lifted on October 28, 2019.&amp;nbsp; The State of Emergency included curfews in multiple cities, which were enforced by police and the armed forces. While the State of Emergency was lifted, there continue to be conflicts between protestors and Chilean police in Santiago and other cities in Chile.&amp;nbsp;You should remain vigilant, monitor local media for updates and avoid protests and demonstrations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Expect disruptions to transportation, particularly in Santiago. The Santiago Metro is operating with limited hours, and service has yet to be restored to the entire network. Road blockages on highways and major thoroughfares may occur with little warning. You should contact your airline prior to travel for any information on potential flight delays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many shopping malls, banks, supermarkets, and restaurants may be operating with reduced working hours, particularly in the evening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you decide to travel to Chile:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Be aware of your surroundings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid demonstrations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep a low profile.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Follow the instructions of local authorities including movement restrictions and obey all curfews.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Find a safe location, and shelter in place if in the vicinity of large gatherings or protests.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Monitor local media and local transportations sites (&lt;a href="https://www.red.cl/">buses&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.metro.cl/">Metro&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://www.nuevopudahuel.cl/?language=en">airport&lt;/a>) for updates and adjust your plans based on new information.&lt;/li>

Avoid all international travel due to the global impact of &lt;a adhocenable="false" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/travel-advisory-alert-global-level-4-health-advisory-issue.html">COVID-19&lt;/a>.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do not travel to the People’s Republic of China (PRC) due to continued COVID-19 travel and quarantine restrictions. Effective March 28, 2020, the PRC suspended entry into the PRC by foreign nationals holding visas or residence permits. Most commercial air carriers reduced or suspended routes to and from the PRC. While exceptions may be granted by PRC authorities, U.S. citizens who are able to enter the PRC will likely be subject to strict mandatory testing and quarantine requirements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Department of State advises U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19. In countries where commercial departure options remain available, U.S. citizens who live in the United States should arrange for immediate return to the United States, unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite period. Those currently in the PRC with an intent to depart should attempt to do so by commercial means. Travelers should be prepared for the possibility of travel restrictions with little or no advance notice, including flight cancelations and delays. U.S. citizens remaining in the PRC should follow the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and PRC health authorities’ guidance for prevention, signs and symptoms, and treatment. We strongly urge U.S. citizens remaining in the PRC to actively monitor and follow local health requirements and restrictions. In the event the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the U.S.&amp;nbsp; Embassy and Consulates to provide assistance to U.S. nationals within the PRC may be limited.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On January 23, 2020, the Department of State ordered the departure of all non-emergency U.S. personnel and their family members from Wuhan. On January 29, 2020, the Department of State allowed for the voluntary departure of non-emergency personnel and family members of U.S. government employees from the PRC. On January 31, 2020, the Department of State ordered the departure of all family members under age 21 of U.S. personnel in the PRC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CDC has issued a &lt;a adhocenable="false" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/china?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001">Global COVID-19 Pandemic Notice&lt;/a> (Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel). The CDC has published suggestions on how to reduce your risk of contracting the novel Coronavirus. Visit the &lt;a adhocenable="false" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">CDC webpage&lt;/a> for expanded information about the novel Coronavirus, including prevention, signs and symptoms, and treatment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Exercise increased caution in the PRC due to &lt;b>arbitrary enforcement of local laws for purposes other than maintaining law and order, including the use of exit bans.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Country Summary:&lt;/b> The PRC government has asserted broad authority to prohibit U.S. citizens and citizens of other countries from leaving the PRC by using “exit bans,” sometimes keeping them in the PRC for years. The PRC government uses exit bans:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>• to compel individuals to participate in PRC government investigations,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>• to pressure family members to return to the PRC from abroad, and&lt;/p>
&lt;p>• to aid PRC authorities in resolving civil disputes in favor of PRC national parties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In most cases, U.S. citizens only become aware of their exit ban when they attempt to depart the PRC, and there is no reliable mechanism or legal process to find out how long the ban might continue or to contest it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>U.S. citizens may be detained without access to U.S. consular services or information about their alleged crime. U.S. citizens may be subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention for reasons related to “state security.” Security personnel may detain and/or deport U.S. citizens for sending private electronic messages critical of the PRC government.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Extra security measures, such as security checks and increased levels of police presence, are common in the Xinjiang Uighur and Tibet Autonomous Regions. Authorities may impose curfews and travel restrictions on short notice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The PRC government does not recognize dual nationality. U.S.-PRC citizens and U.S. citizens of Chinese heritage may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment, and the PRC government may prevent the U.S. Embassy from providing consular services.

&lt;p>If you decide to travel to the PRC:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>• Enter the PRC on your U.S. passport with a valid PRC visa and keep it with you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>• If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or the nearest consulate immediately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>• If you plan to enter North Korea, read the &lt;a adhocenable="false" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/KoreaDemocraticPeoplesRepublicof.html">North Korea Travel Advisory&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>Exercise increased caution in Cuba&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>due to demonstrable and sometimes debilitating injuries to members of our diplomatic community resulting in the drawdown of embassy staff.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Numerous U.S. Embassy Havana employees suffered demonstrable and sometimes debilitating injuries during their service in Havana. Affected individuals have exhibited a range of physical symptoms including ear complaints and hearing loss, dizziness, headaches, fatigue, cognitive issues, visual problems, and difficulty sleeping. We continue to investigate how the health of our diplomats and their family members was severely and permanently damaged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These symptoms occurred in U.S. diplomatic residences (including a long-term apartment at the Atlantic) and at Hotel Nacional and Hotel Capri in Havana.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. Embassy in Havana is operating with reduced staffing. Family members cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in Cuba.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Exercise increased caution in the Dominican Republic due to &lt;b>crime&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Violent crime, including armed robbery, homicide and sexual assault is a concern throughout the Dominican Republic. The development of a professional tourist police corps, institution of a 911 system in many parts of the country, and a concentration of resources in resort areas means these tend to be better policed than urban areas like Santo Domingo. The wide availability of weapons, the use and trade of illicit drugs, and a weak criminal justice system contribute to the high level of criminality on the broader scale.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The U.S. government is limited in its ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the Colombian border area, as U.S. government personnel cannot travel to the provinces of Esmeraldas, Carchi, and Sucumbíos without permission from the Embassy’s security office. However, U.S. government personnel are permitted to travel to the northern bank of the Napo River in Sucumbíos, an area approximately four miles wide, and the portion of Esmeraldas province that is south of Esmeraldas city.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Exercise increased caution in Egypt due to terrorism, and to the Embassy’s limited ability to assist dual U.S.-Egyptian citizens who are arrested or detained. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do not travel to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Sinai Peninsula (with the exception of travel to Sharm El-Sheikh by air) due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>terrorism.&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Western Desert due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>terrorism&lt;/b>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Egyptian border areas due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>military zones.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Egypt. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, and have targeted diplomatic facilities, tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, western businesses, restaurants, resorts, and local government facilities. Terrorists have conducted attacks in urban areas, including in Cairo, despite the heavy security presence. Terrorists have targeted religious sites, to include mosques, churches, monasteries, and buses traveling to these locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Egypt, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Local law prohibits protesting or demonstrating without a permit. Being near anti-government protests can draw scrutiny from Egyptian police and security forces. U.S. citizens have been detained for participating in protests and for posting content on social media perceived as critical of Egypt or its allies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. Embassy may have a limited ability to provide consular services to dual U.S.-Egyptian citizens. Egyptian law considers dual citizens to be Egyptian citizens.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Sinai Peninsula remains a particularly dangerous area, with frequent attacks on security forces and civilians.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens anywhere in the Sinai Peninsula as U.S. government employees are not authorized to travel to these areas (with the exception of the beach resort of Sharm El-Sheikh; travel to Sharm El-Sheikh is only permitted by air).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Exercise increased caution in Eritrea due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>travel restrictions, limited consular assistance&lt;/b>, &lt;b>and landmines.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Eritrea, as U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization to travel outside of Asmara.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eritrean law enforcement officials routinely block access to foreign nationals in detention. The U.S. Embassy therefore may not receive notification or be allowed access to you if you are detained or arrested.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are landmines in many remote areas in Eritrea, particularly in Nakfa, AdiKeih, Arezza, the 25 mile-wide region (40 km) between the Setit and Mereb Rivers, and in areas north and west of Keren, areas near Massawa, Ghinda, Agordat, Barentu, Dekemhare, and south of Tessenae.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you decide to travel to Eritrea:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Use caution when walking and hiking in remote areas or off main roads.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Always carry a copy of your U.S. passport and visa (if applicable). Keep original documents in a secure location.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Exercise increased caution when traveling in Ethiopia due to sporadic&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>civil unrest and communications disruptions. &lt;/b>Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do Not Travel To:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Border area with Somalia due to potential for&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>terrorism, kidnapping, and landmines.&lt;/b> &lt;b>&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Border areas with Kenya, Sudan, South Sudan, and Eritrea due to&lt;b>&amp;nbsp;crime, armed conflict, and civil unrest.&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Reconsider Travel To:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Somali Regional State due to potential for&lt;b> terrorism.&lt;/b> &lt;b>&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ethiopia’s Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People’s Region (SNNPR) due to &lt;b>civil unrest&lt;/b>.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Benishangul Gumuz and the western part of Oromia State due to &lt;b>armed conflict and civil unrest.&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Incidents of civil unrest and ethnic violence may occur without warning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Government of Ethiopia has restricted or shut down internet, cellular data, and phone services during and after civil unrest. These restrictions impede the U.S. Embassy’s ability to communicate with, and provide consular services to, U.S. citizens in Ethiopia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. Embassy has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens outside of Addis Ababa. As a precaution, U.S. government personnel must request permission for any travel outside of Addis Ababa (personal and official), and are required to carry personnel tracking devices and, in some cases, satellite phones.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Monitor local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust your plans.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be aware of your surroundings.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>U.S. citizens who travel abroad should always have a contingency plan for emergency situations. Review the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/checklist.html">Traveler’s Checklist&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Urban Areas – Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Violent crime, such as street mugging, is more frequent in urban areas as compared to their surrounding suburbs. These crimes are also more prevalent at night and in isolated locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens. Local police may lack the resources to respond effectively to more serious crimes.&lt;b>&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Intercity Highways after dark – Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Armed assaults on private vehicles and public transports occur more frequently after dark, often by criminal elements using blockades to slow down and restrict movement of vehicles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Areas near the northern border in the Upper East and Upper West regions – Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>U.S. citizens traveling in Ghana should exercise caution while visiting border areas, in particular the northern border, and be sure to stay abreast of any regional Travel Advisory updates or Security Alerts affecting those areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Parts of the Bono East, Bono, Savannah, Northern, North East, and Upper East regions – Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Civil unrest due to tribal disputes can occur at any time. While such disputes are typically non-violent, the likelihood for violence developing from a tribal dispute is greater in parts of these regions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Reconsider travel to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>crime, civil unrest, &lt;/b>and&lt;b> Ebola&lt;/b>. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Do Not Travel To&lt;/b>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri provinces due to &lt;b>Ebola&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>North Kivu and Ituri provinces due to &lt;b>terrorism&lt;/b>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The eastern DRC region and the three Kasai provinces (Kasai, Kasai-Oriental, Kasai-Central) due to &lt;b>crime&lt;/b>, &lt;b>civil unrest&lt;/b>, &lt;b>armed conflict&lt;/b> and&lt;b> kidnapping&lt;/b>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Country Summary: &lt;/b>Violent crime, such as armed robbery, armed home invasion, and assault, is common and local police lack resources to respond effectively to serious crime. Assailants may pose as police or security agents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Demonstrations are common in many cities and some have turned violent. Police have at times responded with heavy-handed tactics that resulted in civilian casualties and arrests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is an outbreak of the Ebola virus in eastern DRC, which may affect other areas in the country. &amp;nbsp;The CDC issued a &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/ebola-democratic-republic-of-the-congo">Level 2 Travel Notice for Ebola in the DRC&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has extremely limited ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens outside of Kinshasa due to poor infrastructure and security conditions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri Provinces: Level 4—Do Not Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eastern DRC is experiencing an Ebola virus outbreak, with confirmed and probable cases reported in Ituri, North Kivu, and South Kivu provinces.

Road travelers are frequently targeted for ambush, armed robbery, and kidnapping.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Demonstrations and large gatherings can occur throughout these regions, especially in urban areas, and escalate to violence. Extrajudicial mobs can form rapidly and turn violent, posing a threat to humanitarian aid workers and other personnel operating in the area.&lt;/p>
