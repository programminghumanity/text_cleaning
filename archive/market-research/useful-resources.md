## Papers, slides and material about text mining

* Text as data, the classic reference for using text: https://kenbenoit.net/pdfs/28%20Benoit%20Text%20as%20Data%20draft%202.pdf

* This is similar to Text as data, but more focused on the mining rather than analysis, very good read: https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dtingley/files/comparativepoliticstext.pdf
* Good lecture slides and seminar material about text mining, collection of text data, encoding issues etc.: http://pablobarbera.com/ECPR-SC104/code.html
