## Messy list of promising websites

Websites that might be goldmines but would require some time to explore. 

* European Language Resource Coordincation
  * A lot of legal / official documents translated and sometimes already processed. E.g. IP case law, audits, a lot of legal texts from EU countries (not sure how useful they really are, but it is a *lot* of them, there might be some interesting ones)
  * https://elrc-share.eu
* Clarin
  * List of 24 parliamentary corpora, not all easy access
  *  https://www.clarin.eu/resource-families/parliamentary-corpora

* EveryCRSReport.com 
  * Reports from the Congressional Research Service — essentially the national legislature’s think-tank. 
  * https://www.everycrsreport.com/
* Supreme court transcripts
  * https://www.oyez.org/



## Complementary text data 

Texts that are not necessarily directly relevant to political science research but are used for context / complement. E.g. annotate etc.

* Wikipedia or other "ground truth" sources
* Network data
* Dictionaries: e.g. sentiment or emotions to use automated dictionary methods with one click
