# Document types



Brainstorming of all the documents that are of interest to political science researchers. Some preliminary ideas to fill this white page: 



## Priority

* Legislative texts
* Manifesto
* Speeches
* Debates



## Cool to have

Those that have an API would be easy (e.g. UK e-petitions), otherwise might be tricky. **Not a priority, rather for brainstorming purposes**:

* Party websites
* Governmental websites
* Social media posts
* News articles
* Consultations
* Petitions 
* Other papers from open archives?
* Reddit / any social media for context (e.g. public opinion about XYZ)
