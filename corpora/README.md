|  doc-types.md   | Brainstorming of all kind of documents that are of interest to political scientists. |
| corpora-list.md | Categorized list of corpora, description and use.            |



## Purpose

- [ ] List all kind of texts used in political science research (based on desk research and interviews)
- [ ] Link the existing ones
- [ ] Describe how the corpora can be accessed (pdf download, API etc. )
- [ ]  Evaluate how difficult they are to clean, have they already been cleaned etc.



## Some open questions

* Will the corpora be built in? Found via a search tool that directs to the right place? Or upload only but  the software has various options to clean each type of document?
* Is there a file output in addition to the integration with the Jupyter notebook? As in, can the user also export the clean document to a more convenient format? E.g. if they want to share it with the academic community
