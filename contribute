# Contributing

Collecting and cleaning text can be time-consuming. We've started a list of corpora and text cleaning tools or code to make NLP preprocessing easier, but we need your help!

## Guidelines

### Corpora   Collected corpora should be related to political science, but the region and what aspect of political science it enscapsulates is up to you.

### Code   Code should be added to the list of packages or be a Python/R script.

## How to Contribute

If you would like to contribute a corpora or code, head to the corresponding .md file. From there you can add a new results but clickingon the edit button in the top-right corner.

Click on the edit button to add a file

This allows you to edit the file in Markdown. Simply add a row to the corresponding table in the same format. Make sure that the table stays sorted (with the best result on top). After you've made your change, make sure that the table still looks ok by clicking on the "Preview changes" tab at the top of the page. If everything looks good, go to the bottom of the page, where you see the below form.

Fill out the file change information

Add a name for your proposed change, an optional description, indicate that you would like to "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request", and click on "Propose file change".

The format of the entry should match the headings of the table and include the same information:

| Item | Country | Description | Access | Link |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|------|
|Name of the Corpora|Country or region|Number of observations or what type of data |Bulk download, API, csv, etc.|url|
