Contributing
============

Collecting and cleaning text can be time-consuming. We've created a list of corpora, text cleaning tools, and code to make NLP pre-processing easier -- but we need your help! With your contributions, our list of resources can grow and be shared with the NLP community. 

Guidelines
----------

Corpora
^^^^^^^

Collected corpora should be related to political science, but the region and what aspect of political science it encapsulates is up to you.

Code
^^^^

Code should be added to the list of packages or be a Python/R script.
