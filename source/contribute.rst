Contributing
============

Collecting and cleaning text can be time-consuming. We've created a list of corpora, text cleaning tools, and code to make NLP pre-processing easier -- but we need your help! With your contributions, our list of resources can grow and be shared with the NLP community. 

Guidelines

Corpora
^^^^^^^

Collected corpora should be related to political science, but the region and what aspect of political science it encapsulates is up to you. 

Transformations
^^^^

You can add your own transformations through a pull request with this `template <https://github.com/sagepublishing/text_cleaning/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md>`_
